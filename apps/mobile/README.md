# T3 Code Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `T3 Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

T3 Connect is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. Public configuration belongs in the
repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`, not an `apps/mobile/.env` file. See
[`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example).

## Development

Start Metro for the dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

If your Xcode account only has a Personal Team, use a bundle identifier you control and opt into the
reduced-capability local build. Personal Team builds omit the widget and share extensions, push
entitlement, and native Sign in with Apple entitlement; builds without this opt-in are unchanged.

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code.dev \
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and install a self-contained Release app that does not need Metro:

```bash
vp run ios:release
```

### Fork builds signed with your own Apple team

A self-built fork cannot use the upstream bundle identifiers (`com.t3tools.t3code*`
are registered to T3 Tools) and must not sign against the upstream team. Set these
in the repository-root `.env.local`:

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code
T3CODE_IOS_TEAM_ID=YOURTEAMID
```

- `T3CODE_IOS_TEAM_ID` is your 10-character Apple Developer team ID. When unset,
  builds sign against the upstream team exactly as before.
- `T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1` is a reduced-capability switch, not a
  Personal-Team-only switch. It is worth setting even on a paid account for a
  first build: it drops the widget and share extensions, the push entitlement,
  and native Sign in with Apple, which removes all App Group and push
  provisioning work. None of them are needed to pair with a local T3 backend.
- Setting it also disables Expo OTA updates for the build, so a fork build never
  pulls JavaScript from upstream's Expo channel and silently replaces its own
  bundle on first launch.

Then build straight to a plugged-in device (developer mode enabled, device
trusted):

```bash
vp run ios:device
```

The Personal Team equivalent also needs a unique bundle identifier:

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code \
vp run ios:release
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Force the review diff highlighter engine:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=javascript vp run ios:dev
```

`javascript` is the default and recommended setting for the review diff screen. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=native` only when you explicitly want to test the native Shiki engine.

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

CI uses Expo fingerprinting with the `preview:dev` profile to reuse an existing compatible build when possible, or start a new internal EAS build when native runtime inputs change. Production and default local builds continue to use the `appVersion` runtime policy.

For preview or production EAS environments, set `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
`T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`, and `T3CODE_RELAY_URL`
as EAS environment variables. Expo config maps the canonical values into the mobile build.

Create a PR preview dev-client build manually:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview:dev
```

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```
